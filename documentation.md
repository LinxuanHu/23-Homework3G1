# To find the time period of simple pendulum
Simple Pendulum is a small bob of mass m, also known as pendulum bob which is suspended from
a light wire or string. The period of pendulum is the time required for pendulum to complete one oscillation. One oscillation is the motion of the pendulum beginning at some reference point and continuing untill the reference point is reached again. The time period (T) is estimated using:

L is the length of the string and g is acceleration due to gravity
# Objectives
1 To use a classical mechanics function as a python function and using this function as an argument in another function.
# Steps to implement
- Define a classical mechanics function as periodic time with arguments l and g.
- Use Lambda function is used to calculate the periodic time.
- List the length values.
- Use map function to calculate time using each element in the lists.
- Create a list of periodic times using the map elements.
- Print results which takes the periodic time of index 0 in the length list and give its 
   corresponding value in the time lists.
- The process is repeated
  # Functions used
- Lambda Function : Lambda function is used as a substitute for fully fledge name function to use it as a simple operation. They have limitations in comparision to function defined by 'def'. They are mostly used for simple one linear operations and are not preferred for multisteps complex operations
- Map function: Map function is used to apply a specificed function to each item in an iterable and return a new iterable containing the results.
