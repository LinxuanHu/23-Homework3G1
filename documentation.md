# To find the time period of simple pendulum
Simple Pendulum is a small bob of mass m, also known as pendulum bob which is suspended from
a light wire or string. The period of pendulum is the time required for pendulum to complete one oscillation. One oscillation is the motion of the pendulum beginning at some reference point and continuing untill the reference point is reached again. The time period (T) is estimated using:

L is the length of the string and g is acceleration due to gravity
